WARNING: The quality of the data for 1959-1969 is lower than in the later years and these data should be used with caution.  There has also been an increasing problem with the quality of the population estimates at ages 80+ years since the mid-1990s. For details, please refer to the "Data Quality Issues" section of the Background and Documentation file.
