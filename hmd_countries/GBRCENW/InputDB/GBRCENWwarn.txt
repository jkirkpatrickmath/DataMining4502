The data given here represent only the civilian population. During the periods between pre-war and post-war censuses (1912-20 and 1939-50), population estimates exclude the military while death counts exclude military deaths that occurred abroad. For all other years, the period data in this series are identical to those given for the total population. This series also includes cohort life tables, but we caution the user that they are of questionable value for cohorts that experienced significant military losses during war. For details, please see the Background and Documentation.
