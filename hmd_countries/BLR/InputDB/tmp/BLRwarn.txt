WARNING: The quality of the data for 1959-1969 is lower than in later years, 
and therefore estimates of life expectancy at birth and at older ages may 
be overestimated during this period. Likewise, estimates of life expectancy 
at age 80 may be too high even as late as the 1970s. For details, please see 
the "Data Quality Issues" section of the
