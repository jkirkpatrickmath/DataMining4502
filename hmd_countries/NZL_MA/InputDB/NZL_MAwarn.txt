WARNING: The data for Maori can be used only as a guide for research due
to data quality problems. The most inconsistent are mortality estimates
at older ages, which are problematic even for the most recent years.
Data before and after 1996 are based on different definitions of
ethnicity. For details, please see the Background and Documentation
file.
