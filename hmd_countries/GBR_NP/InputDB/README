I have put scratch versions of Input and LexisDB aggregation scripts here.  
There is a problem with the National Population.  The InputDB files are left blank and the LexisDB is
the aggregate of the regions (SCO, NIR, ENW).  I am not sure how monthlybirths are determined.
At any rate, the diagnostic charts fail in this situation.  I have stepped through a few
R charts that can be produced with the partial data.  Better would be to construct pseudo-
data by aggregating InputDB files from the regions.  Then a full diagnostic would be 
meaningful.

Hi Carl,


Herewith I am sending you the Matlab scripts for UK parts and NLD. Each of =
them includes some explanations. Although comments are incomplete, I hope t=
hat they explain the basic steps.


The script for GBR_SCO includes a special method for splitting 5 year pop c=
ounts.


The scripts for GBRCENW and GBRTENW are specific.

We use previously published parts of the Lexis files restricted to the peri=
od until 1962. Then we perform calculations for the GBRCENW for the period =
1963 onward including the most recent years. These new Lexis estimates are =
added (appended) to both the GBRCENW and GBRTENW restricted until 1962.


Finally, GBR_NP is just a sum of the Lexis files for GBRCENW, GBR_NIR, and =
GBR_SCO.


Best,


Domas
