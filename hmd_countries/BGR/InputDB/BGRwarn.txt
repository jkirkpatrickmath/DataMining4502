WARNING: The quality of the data for 1947-1969 is lower than that in later years, and these data, especially at ages above 60, should be used with caution. 

Population estimates for 2002-2010 should also be used with caution as they do not reflect actual migration during this period. 

For details, please see the "Data Quality Issues" section of the Background and Documentation file (for Bulgaria).
